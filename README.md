Colossus Platform
=================

Colossus is platform to run distributed services using containers.

Components
----------

The Colossus is comprised of the following components:

* CoreOS - The Operating System
	* Etcd - The Distributed key-value store
	* Fleet - The Distributed init System
* Consul - The Service Discovery
	* Registrator - The Docker Bridge
	* HAProxy - The Proxy & Load Balancer
* Docker - The Container Runtime

For more details about each component check [architecture](https://github.com/harbur/colossus/tree/master/docs/architecture)

Installation
------------

To Install Colossus follow these Steps:

* [Create a Coreos Cluster](https://coreos.com/os/docs/latest/booting-on-ec2.html)
* [Install Harbur CLI](http://docs.harbur.io/en/latest/installation/harbur-cli/index.html)
* [Configure Virtual IP](https://github.com/harbur/colossus/tree/master/docs/VIP)
* [Configure Wildcard DNS](https://github.com/harbur/colossus/tree/master/docs/DNS)
* [Launch Consul in CoreOS Cluster](https://cloud.harbur.io/unitfiles/harbur/consul)
* [Launch Registrator in CoreOS Cluster](https://cloud.harbur.io/unitfiles/harbur/registrator-consul)
* [Launch HAProxy in CoreOS Cluster](https://cloud.harbur.io/unitfiles/harbur/haproxy-consul)
* [Configure Docker DNS Search](https://github.com/harbur/colossus/tree/master/docs/dockerDNS)

## Using Colossus

## Run Redis Server

Connect to a node with SSH and run:

```shell
$ docker run --name redis_server -d -p 6379:6379 redis
```

This will start a redis server in the node. Registrator will pick-up the container creation event and register it to Consul Backend. You can verify that at the Consul UI (http://cluster.local:8500/)

Since Consul is your DNS server on the cluster, all services are now discoverable by DNS. To verify that go to another node and run:

```shell
$ ping redis.service.consul
PING redis.service.consul (10.0.0.100) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from coreos1.node.dc1.consul (10.0.0.100): icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.294 ms
```

For more information about the Consul DNS discovery review [Consul DNS Interface](https://www.consul.io/docs/agent/dns.html)

This also works inside a container as expected:

```shell
$ docker run --rm -it redis ping redis.service.consul
PING redis.service.consul (10.0.0.100): 48 data bytes
56 bytes from 10.0.0.10: icmp_seq=0 ttl=64 time=0.151 ms
```

Since we configured the [Docker DNS Search](https://github.com/harbur/colossus/tree/master/docs/dockerDNS) The service is also discoverable using just the service name:

```shell
$ docker run --rm -it redis ping redis
PING redis.service.consul (10.0.0.100): 48 data bytes
56 bytes from 10.0.0.100: icmp_seq=0 ttl=64 time=0.187 ms
```

## Run an Nginx Service

```shell
$ docker run -d -p 80 -e SERVICE_NAME=example nginx
```

Open http://example.cluster.local to see the nginx server.
